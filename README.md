### Spots Page:

This page displays a title, description, image, and reviews for a given spot. If the user is the owner of the spot and is logged in, the user will have the ability to edit and delete the spot from this page. The owner of the spot may not leave a review on their own spot. Owners of a review for a specific spot will be able to delete and edit their review for a given spot. No more than one review per spot!
